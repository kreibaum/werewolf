# Werewolf

Werewolf is a helper tool for moderating groups playing werewolf. It should work as a flexible notepad
that helps the moderator keep track of role assignments and choices made at night.

I hope to include some automated suggestions, but the interface should not force any rules on the moderator.

The strings are currently in german and will remain german until I implement propper translations.

## Development

This tool does not use a server and is written as an [Elm](https://elm-lang.org) single page app.
